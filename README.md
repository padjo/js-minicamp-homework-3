# Homework #3

1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Objects : Objects are are way of storing collections of related data (properties) and functions (methods). They are stored in key : value pairings.
	* Properties : properties are object values reference by keys.
	* Methods : These are object functions
	* for in loop : a for in loop is a convenient way of iterating through an object
	* dot notation vs bracket notation : you can access object properties using object.key notation but if
	  you only have a holding variable name for the key you need to use bracket notation otherwise if you use dot notation , it will look for the literal value of the variable which does not exist. 


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
